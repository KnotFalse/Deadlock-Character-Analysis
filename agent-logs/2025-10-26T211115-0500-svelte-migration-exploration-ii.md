# Session Notes (Svelte exploration II)

- **Branch**: feature/svelte-migration-exploration
- Implemented store parity (filters, neighbor/path, metric modes, rankings) and four Svelte panels (Sidebar, PathTools, RelationshipPanel, AnalyticsPanel).
- Enhanced GraphView with Sigma highlight layering (neighbor/path/edge/metric/search) and click events that update stores.
- Built locally; pushed branch. Next: copy Playwright tests to website-svelte, add light-mode test hook, and wire a build+test CI job (no Pages deploy yet to avoid clobbering the React site).

## Commands
- cd website-svelte && npm run build

## Next
- Port Playwright tests to website-svelte; add a CI workflow.
