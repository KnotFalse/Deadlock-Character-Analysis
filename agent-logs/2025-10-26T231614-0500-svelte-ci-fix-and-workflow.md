# Session Log â€” Svelte CI fix and workflow

- Timestamp: 2025-10-26T23:16:15.0321802-05:00
- Repo: deadlock-character-analysis
- Branch: feature/svelte-migration-exploration @ 2849d3e

## Summary
- Implemented search results list in website-svelte/src/components/Sidebar.svelte to allow selecting nodes when canvas is disabled in CI.
- Added path summary UI in website-svelte/src/components/PathTools.svelte to expose computed shortest path.
- Wired clickStage to clear selections in website-svelte/src/components/GraphView.svelte.
- Fixed Playwright smoke test; local run now passes.
- Added CI workflow .github/workflows/website-svelte-build.yml to build + run e2e on PR/push affecting website-svelte/**.
- Hardened repo hygiene: updated .gitignore to exclude website-svelte/dist/, 
ode_modules/, Playwright artifacts; removed tracked dist/.

## Rationale / Notes
- Previous smoke test failed due to no clickable search result UI and missing path summary markup targeted by the test. Implemented minimal, accessible UI to address both while keeping design consistent.
- Kept Svelte 4 + svelte-preprocess per prior decision; defer Svelte 5 plugin switch until tests are stable in CI.
