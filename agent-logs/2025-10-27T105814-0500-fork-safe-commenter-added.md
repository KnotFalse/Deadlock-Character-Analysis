# Session Log — Fork-safe preview commenter

- Timestamp: 2025-10-27T10:58:15.0930758-05:00
- Repo: deadlock-character-analysis
- Branch: feature/svelte-migration-exploration @ 796ca32

## Summary
- Added .github/workflows/comment-preview-on-workflow-run.yml: posts preview comments safely for fork PRs using workflow_run (no checkout of PR code).
- Reads graph.json from fork head_repository@head_sha to include node/edge counts and generated_at, and links run artifacts.
- Keeps existing in-PR comment step for internal PRs (guarded and non-fatal).

## Next
- Verify the commenter runs when the build workflow completes on a fork PR and posts counts successfully.
