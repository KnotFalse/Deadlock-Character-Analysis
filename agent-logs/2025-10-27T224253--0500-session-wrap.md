Repo: deadlock-character-analysis
Branch: feature/ui-bugfix-and-ux-pass @ 10daf22
Date: 2025-10-27T22:42:53

## Summary
- Implemented Phase 1–3,6 of UI/UX pass (baseSize + visibility; density + combobox polish; relationship grid; path combobox).
- Added tests for relationship headings & path combobox; updated existing specs.
- Authored idioms audit: docs/sveltekit-idioms-audit-2025-10-28.md and appended NEXT-STEPS addendum.

## Next Steps (high level)
- Finalize Sigma label hover background + dark-mode legibility.
- Runes migration: events → onclick*, export let → , local derived → .
- Imports: '/types' → /types; standardize  imports.
- Combobox a11y: aria-activedescendant + option ids.
- Add canvas-enabled tests for size inflation + analytics sizing.
