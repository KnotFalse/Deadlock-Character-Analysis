- Timestamp: 2025-10-27T08:11:52.2722611-05:00
- Repo: deadlock-character-analysis
- Branch: feature/svelte-migration-exploration @ c6f5071

## Summary
- Regenerated website-sveltekit/package-lock.json (ajv + ajv-formats) via 
pm install; verified 
pm ci now succeeds locally.
- Built SvelteKit and ran Playwright tests locally — all 6 specs passed.
- Committed and pushed the new lockfile so Actions 
pm ci will install cleanly.

## Next
- Watch the website-sveltekit build-and-test job on GitHub for green.
- Then confirm Pages deploy job is green on main.
