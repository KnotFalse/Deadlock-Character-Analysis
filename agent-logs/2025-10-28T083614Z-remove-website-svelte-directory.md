# Session Log: Remove website-svelte Directory

**Date:** 2025-10-28T08:36:14Z  
**Branch:** `copilot/remove-website-svelte-directory`  
**Repository:** KnotFalse/Deadlock-Character-Analysis  
**Commit:** d711f81

## Objective

Delete the `website-svelte` directory and all related references from the repository as requested in the issue.

## Changes Made

### 1. Deleted Directory
- Removed the entire `website-svelte/` directory including:
  - Source code (Svelte components, TypeScript files)
  - Configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, playwright.config.ts)
  - Package files (package.json, package-lock.json)
  - Node modules (should have been gitignored but were committed)
  - Test files and results
  - Built artifacts

### 2. Removed Workflow File
- Deleted `.github/workflows/website-svelte-build.yml` - the CI workflow that built and tested the website-svelte application

### 3. Updated Documentation
- **README.md**: Removed reference to "Svelte (SPA exploration): see `website-svelte/` for local tests" on line 110
- Updated line 111 to simplify reference to SvelteKit (removed "(target)" label)

### 4. Updated .gitignore
- Removed website-svelte build artifact entries:
  - `website-svelte/node_modules/`
  - `website-svelte/dist/`
  - `website-svelte/playwright-report/`
  - `website-svelte/test-results/`
- Kept website-sveltekit entries intact

## Verification

- Confirmed `website-svelte` directory no longer exists
- Confirmed `website-sveltekit` directory remains intact
- Verified workflow file `.github/workflows/website-svelte-build.yml` is deleted
- Only SvelteKit-related workflows remain:
  - `pages-deploy-sveltekit.yml`
  - `website-sveltekit-build.yml`
- Git status shows clean working tree
- All changes committed and pushed successfully

## Notes

The website-svelte directory was an exploratory SPA implementation that has been superseded by the website-sveltekit implementation. The repository now has a cleaner structure with:
- `website/` - React (Vite) explorer (deprecated, for reference)
- `website-sveltekit/` - Current canonical SvelteKit application

No functionality was lost as website-sveltekit provides all the features that were in website-svelte.
