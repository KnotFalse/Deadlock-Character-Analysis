# Session Log â€” SvelteKit style polish

Repo: Deadlock-Character-Analysis
Branch: feature/style-polish @ af28e69

## Changes
- Added theme tokens (dark default, light override) and utility classes in website-sveltekit/src/app.css.
- Layout header with theme toggle and container in src/routes/+layout.svelte.
- Converted page structure to grid + cards in src/routes/+page.svelte.
- Sidebar: legend with label colors, styled inputs/selects, improved checkbox row.
- Graph: colors now bound to CSS variables; graph card uses themed surface.
- Path/Analytics: unified button/select styles; pill toggles.

## Notes
- Build passes locally; Vite shows non-reactive warning for toggle label (theme still applies). Optional follow-up: convert 	heme to $state if we want the button label to change instantly.
- No functional changes; pure presentation.
