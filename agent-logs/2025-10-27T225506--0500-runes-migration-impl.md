Branch: feature/ui-bugfix-and-ux-pass @ d264dae
Date: 2025-10-27T22:55:06

## Changes
- Events: replaced on:* with property handlers across components.
- Props: GraphView uses ; +page.ts added with load(); +page.svelte consumes data via  + .
- Imports: '/types' â†’ /types; AnalyticsPanel imports normalized to /stores/graph.
- Combobox a11y: aria-activedescendant, stable option ids, li role=option onclick.
- Sigma labels: labelColor node attribute wired; custom defaultDrawNodeHover without white bg.

## Next
- Run Playwright locally and adjust if any selectors changed.
- Add canvas-enabled specs for size inflation and analytics sizing.
- Final pass on combobox a11y (focus management, escape handling already in place).
