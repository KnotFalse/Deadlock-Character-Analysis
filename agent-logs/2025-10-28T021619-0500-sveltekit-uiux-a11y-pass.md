# Session Log â€” SvelteKit UI/UX + a11y pass

- Started: 2025-10-28 02:16:19 -05:00
- Repo: deadlock-character-analysis: main @ 1f9e8c7

## Notes
- Read AGENTS.md, plan.md, and docs/NEXT-STEPS-UI-UX.md (incl. 2025-10-28 addendum).
- Verified Svelte 5 runes usage (//) and property-style events.
- Confirmed +page.ts loads graph.json (ssr=false) and UI gates panels behind appReady.
- Adjusted app-ready sentinel visibility per E2E readiness plan.
- Built app successfully via vite build.
## Results
- Build: success (vite build).
- Playwright: 10/10 tests passed locally (chromium).
- Notable UI changes: visible app-ready sentinel; Relationship Panel button (idempotent open); Path Tools combobox prioritizes Characters; Combobox no auto-refocus to avoid double listboxes; GraphView hydration safeguards.
