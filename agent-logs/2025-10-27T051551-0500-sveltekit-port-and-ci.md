# Session Log â€” SvelteKit port + CI

- Timestamp: 2025-10-27T05:15:51.8093841-05:00
- Repo: deadlock-character-analysis
- Branch: feature/svelte-migration-exploration @ 5a5a8ad

## Summary
- Scaffolded website-sveltekit (Svelte 5 + SvelteKit v2) with adapter-static, CSR-only via +layout.ts.
- Ported components/stores/types from website-svelte, wired global styles, and copied graph.json to static/.
- Added Playwright config and copied smoke test; adjusted root #app ID.
- Added CI workflow website-sveltekit-build.yml to build + test and upload the uild/ artifact.
- Perf: throttled highlight updates via rAF; debounced search input.

## Notes / Decisions
- Keep React Pages as live site; SvelteKit previews provided as workflow artifacts to avoid clobbering.
- Next: a11y hooks (ARIA/testids) and JSON schema validation for graph.json in CI.
