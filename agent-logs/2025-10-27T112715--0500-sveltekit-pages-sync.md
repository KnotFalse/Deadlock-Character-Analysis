# Session Log — SvelteKit Pages sync

Repo: Deadlock-Character-Analysis
Branch: main @ c198685
Date: 2025-10-27T11:27:15

## Actions
- Pulled latest from origin; local main is in sync with github/main.
- Verified SvelteKit configuration:
  - svelte.config.js uses adapter-static and paths.relative=true.
  - src/routes/+page.svelte fetches graph.json via a relative path.
  - static/graph.json present; schema validation uses Ajv 2020-12.
- CI/workflows present and correct:
  - .github/workflows/pages-deploy-sveltekit.yml builds, validates, tests, deploys via ctions/deploy-pages.
  - .github/workflows/website-sveltekit-build.yml builds/tests and uploads preview artifacts; internal PR commenter is non-fatal and skips forks.
  - .github/workflows/comment-preview-on-workflow-run.yml posts fork-safe PR comments after workflow_run.
- Ran locally:
  - 
pm ci in website-sveltekit — OK.
  - 
pm run validate:graph — OK (nodes/edges matched expected counts).
  - 
pm run build — OK; static site emitted to website-sveltekit/build/.
- Repository updates:
  - Updated README.md to mark SvelteKit as the live site and added Pages URL.
  - Touched website-sveltekit/static/robots.txt to trigger Pages redeploy.

## Notes
- The earlier 404 at https://knotfalse.github.io/graph.json was caused by an absolute fetch. The app now fetches graph.json relatively, so Project Pages base path resolves correctly.
- Ajv meta-schema error addressed by switching to jv/dist/2020.js and adding jv-formats.
- Fork PR commenter is now fork-safe via workflow_run.
