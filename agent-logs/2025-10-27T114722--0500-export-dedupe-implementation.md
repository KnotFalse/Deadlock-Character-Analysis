# Session Log — Export dedupe implementation

Repo: Deadlock-Character-Analysis
Branch: feature/export-dedupe @ ef99c56
Date: 2025-10-27T11:47:22

## Changes
- Validator: website-sveltekit/scripts/validate-graph.mjs
  - Adds STRICT mode and duplicate checks (node IDs, edge IDs, undirected pair duplicates).
  - New npm script: validate:graph:strict (uses cross-env for Windows/CI).
- CI:
  - export-graph.yml now runs strict validation after export.
  - website-sveltekit-build.yml validates graph strictly before building/tests.
- Exporter aggregation: src/deadlock_graph/cli.py
  - Aggregates edges by (type, source, target); merges evidence_count, reasons[], and ability_sources.
  - Drops EVEN edges when STRONG/WEAK exist for a pair; keeps a single canonical EVEN direction.
  - Recomputes indexes from aggregated edges.
- UI: RelationshipPanel shows evidence_count and aggregated reasons.
- Docs: README updated with data quality & aggregation policy.

## Local Validation
- npm run validate:graph:strict → PASS (dupNodeIds=0 dupEdgeIds=0 dupEdgePairs=0)
- SvelteKit build → PASS.

## Notes
- Frontend still guards against duplicate edges, but should not trigger now that export is clean.
- Graph edges reduced (after aggregation), improving render performance.


## PR
- Opened PR #5: Export dedupe: aggregate edges, strict validation, CI gates
- Auto-merge enabled (squash) and branch cleanup on success
- Initial CI runs in progress: website-sveltekit build and test, Website Build, Sanity
