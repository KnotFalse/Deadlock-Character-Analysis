# Session Notes

- **Branch**: feature/static-graph-plan @ dd02568
- Added a CI-only "graph light mode" toggle so Playwright runs skip WebGL rendering; Sigma canvas now mounts only in production mode, eliminating software GPU warnings.
- Extended analytics coverage: expanded state exposes ranking data globally for tests, new Playwright scenario exercises metric toggles and mechanic filtering, and README documents the analytics dashboard plus light-mode testing behavior.
- Updated GraphView/store plumbing to avoid duplicate edges in pathfinding while preserving multi-edge visualization when rendering is enabled.
- Refreshed Playwright config with explicit GL flags and reused npm scripts so `npm run test:e2e` handles build + smoke runs.

## Commands
- npm install
- npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
- npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list --timeout=90000

## Outstanding
- Keep an eye on Chromium WebGL warnings; current mitigation disables rendering in CI, but future visual regression tests may require a headless-friendly renderer.
