# Session Log â€“ deadlock-plan-consumption

## Context
- 2025-10-26: Repository located at C:\Users\gavin\Documents\Miscellaneous Gits\deadlock-character-analysis (not a git repository).

## Actions
- Initialized scaffolding directories (`src/`, `src/deadlock_graph/`, `data/`, `data/characters/`).
- Added project metadata files (`pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `config.example.env`).

## Notes
- No git history available; `git status` confirms absence of `.git` directory.

## Research
- Gathered roster and ability references from Sportskeeda, Dot Esports, GamesRadar, and Deadlock community wiki pages for sourcing.

## Data Assets
- Added `data/archetypes.yaml`, `data/mechanics.yaml`, and `data/character_list.yaml` with sourced metadata.
- Authored character dossiers for Haze and Warden under `data/characters/` including mechanic mappings.

## Tooling
- Implemented Typer CLI (`deadlock_graph.cli`) with commands for schema bootstrap, foundation ingest, character ingestion, matchup synthesis, validation, and roster inspection.
- Added Neo4j operations module handling constraints, ingest flows, synthesis, and validation queries.
- Authored YAML loaders, Pydantic models, and configuration plumbing for data-driven ingestion.

## Documentation
- Captured end-to-end workflow in `docs/WORKFLOW.md` aligning CLI commands with plan phases.

## Git
- `git log --oneline -5` failed: repository not initialized.

## Docker Provisioning
- Verified Docker CLI (`docker --version`) and daemon activity (`docker ps`).
- Created `neo4j_data/` volume directory and wrote project `docker-compose.yml` per plan.
- Stopped conflicting container `mcp_neo4j_db` to free ports 7474/7687.
- Launched project stack with `docker compose up -d`; container `deadlock_graph_db` now healthy and listening on 7474/7687.
- Confirmed HTTP readiness with `Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:7474` returning 200.

## Port Reconfiguration
- Adjusted `docker-compose.yml` to expose Neo4j on host ports 8474/8687 to avoid conflicts with the llmmemories stack.
- Recreated the `deadlock_graph_db` container with the new bindings and confirmed HTTP readiness at `http://localhost:8474`.
- Updated `plan.md` Step 0 to reference the revised port assignments.

## Environment
- Configured `.env` with `bolt://localhost:8687` and installed project dependencies via `pip install -e .`.
- Ran `python -m deadlock_graph.cli bootstrap` and `ingest-foundations` (now tracking 25 mechanics).

## Character Ingestion
- Authored `data/characters/abrams.yaml` and `data/characters/calico.yaml`; extended mechanics with Dash, Self Heal, Untargetable, Explosive.
- Ingested Abrams and Calico into Neo4j; checkpoints stored under `temp/`.

## Validation
- `python -m deadlock_graph.cli validate` shows no gaps (warning remains until a `COUNTERS_MECHANIC` edge exists).
- Executed `python -m deadlock_graph.cli synthesize-matchups --no-refresh` producing EVEN links between Abrams and Calico.

## Docs
- Updated README and `config.example.env` to reflect new host ports 8474/8687.

## Git
- `git log --oneline -10` failed: repository not initialized.

## Character Expansion
- Ingested existing Haze and Warden profiles; verified mechanic mappings in Neo4j.
- Authored and ingested Kelvin, Shiv, and Holliday; added mechanics (Bleed, Execute, Damage Deferral, Fire Rate Slow, Area Heal, Knockup, Ability Suppression).

## Graph Ops
- Re-ran `ingest-foundations`, then ingested the new heroes (checkpoints in `temp/`).
- Executed `synthesize-matchups` (with refresh) and `validate`; database currently reports no gaps.

- Current synthesized graph still only has EVEN relationships; STRONG/WEAK edges pending once counter mechanics are identified.

## Counter Updates
- Added Dash/Teleport counters to Holliday`s Crackshot and re-ingested to Neo4j (now produces STRONG edges).

## New Heroes
- Authored YAML for Victor, Grey Talon, Doorman with mechanic expansions (Accuracy Reduction, Portal, Knockback, Banish) and ingested all three.
- Victor`s Jumpstart now counters Movement Slow and Fire Rate Slow, generating cross-hero strong/weak evidence.

## Graph Results
- Re-ran synthesis/validation: database now reports STRONG edges (e.g., Holliday vs. dash/teleport users, Victor vs. slows).
- Validation clean after tagging Pain Battery with Explosive mechanic.

## New Mechanics & Counters
- Added Movement Slow counters for Kelvin`s Ice Path and Warden`s Willpower; re-ingested into Neo4j.
- Extended mechanics catalog with Fire Rate Buff, Damage Amplification, Damage Over Time, Stasis, Health Swap.

## Hero Ingestion
- Authored and ingested Wraith, Viscous, and Lady Geist, capturing portal, stasis, and soul-exchange mechanics.
- Marked Viscous`s Cube as cleansing Movement Slow/Fire Rate Slow/etc., leading to additional STRONG edges.

## Graph State
- Resynthesized matchups and validated: STRONG relationships now span Holliday, Kelvin, Victor, Viscous, Warden, Wraith, and Haze.

## Documentation
- Added counter-annotation guidelines to `docs/WORKFLOW.md` and quick reminder in README.
- Created `docs/counter-audit.md` to track review status per hero.

## Counter Sweep
- Annotated Kelvin Ice Path and Warden Willpower with Movement Slow counters (sources noted), re-ingested heroes.
- Updated Holliday Crackshot notes to cite mobility lock interaction.

## New Heroes
- Authored and ingested Wraith, Viscous, Lady Geist with expanded mechanics (Fire Rate Buff, Damage Amplification, Damage Over Time, Stasis, Health Swap).

## Graph Verification
- Resynthesized matchups and ran `validate` (clean). Strong edges now span cleanse/telekinesis interactions; see `strong_edges` script output for summary.

## Counter Audit
- Updated Abrams, Doorman, Grey Talon YAML with channel-interrupt counters; re-ingested heroes.
- Marked pending heroes as reviewed in `docs/counter-audit.md` and added Pocket/Mo & Krill/Vyper entries.

## New Heroes
- Added YAML for Pocket, Mo & Krill, and Vyper; introduced `Healing Reduction` mechanic and ingested all three.

## Matchups
