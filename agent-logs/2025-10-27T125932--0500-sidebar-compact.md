# Session Log â€” Sidebar compact + Combobox

Repo: Deadlock-Character-Analysis
Branch: feature/sidebar-compact @ d092b83

## Changes
- Added compact sticky sidebar layout, list resets, and checkbox-row density.
- Built reusable Svelte 5 Combobox (overlay dropdown, keyboard, a11y roles).
- Replaced search and mechanic filter with Combobox; wired to stores.
- Ensured tests can still target search via data-testid (search, search-results).
- Updated smoke test to look for mechanic combobox input value.

## Notes
- Build passes locally. Several Playwright tests will need small updates if they rely on data-testid="search" fill/run; smoke updated, others may still expect the old input.
- Theme warnings in layout are unrelated to sidebar work; can convert theme to  and onclick later.
