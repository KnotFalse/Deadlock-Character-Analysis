# Session Log â€” PR comment enrichment, schema governance, export hardening

- Timestamp: 2025-10-27T07:54:24.9152633-05:00
- Repo: deadlock-character-analysis
- Branch: feature/svelte-migration-exploration @ 17cac6c

## Changes
- SvelteKit CI PR comment now includes node/edge counts and generated_at (parsed from static/graph.json).
- Schema governance: added schema/CHANGELOG.md and PR template checkbox; validate script prints schema id/version along with counts.
- Export pipeline hardening: skip PRs when no diff (hash-check), set artifact retention, label PRs as data:update.

## Notes
- Next: add optional post-deploy health probe; perf advisories (non-gating) once we gather baseline runs.
