      uses:
        - Sleep
        - Movement Slow
      counters: []
    notes: >
      The ability text explicitly states that Sleep Dagger does not interrupt channeling,
      so it should not be treated as a hard counter to channelled ultimates.

    slot: Shift
    type: mobility
    description: >
      Teleports to a target location and leaves behind a firing illusion that mimics
